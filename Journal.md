## Day 02 - IP Management


I observed how to check network connections on both **Windows Server** using `ipconfig` and on **Linux** using `ip addr`. This helped me understand how to view **network interfaces**, see which ones are **active**, check assigned **IP addresses** for each and other important network onfigurations. It gave me a clearer picture of how devices are connected and identified on a network.



## Day 01 - Cloud Environment Setup

I set up a **cloud environment** with a **VPC** serving as a virtual network, a **security group** to manage access, and launched **Windows, Ubuntu, and RedHat servers** with appropriate **network interfaces** that we would use throught the bootcamp. I generated **PEM and PPK keys** for authentication, used **Pageant and PuTTY** and **RDP** for secure access, and assigned **Elastic IPs** to ensure static addressing for my servers. The Windows server acts as the primary host, while other instances are used for testing. Through this process, I reinforced **key networking concepts**, including **basic cloud networking, security rules, SSH authentication, and cloud resource management**.
